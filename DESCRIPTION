Description: The concept of reliable and clinically significant change
    (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) helps you answer the following questions for a
    sample with two measurements at different points in time (pre & post):
    Which proportion of my sample has a (considering the reliability of the
    instrument) probably not-just-by-chance difference in pre- vs. post-scores?
    Which proportion of my sample does not only change in a statistically
    significant way (see question one), but also in a clinically significant way
    (e.g. change from a test score regarded "dysfunctional" to a score regarded
    "functional")?
    This package allows you to very easily create a scatterplot of your sample
    in which the x-axis maps to the pre-scores, the y-axis maps to the
    post-scores and several graphical elements (lines, colors) allow you to gain
    a quick overview about reliable changes in these scores.
    An example of this kind of plot is Figure 2 of Jacobson & Truax (1991).
